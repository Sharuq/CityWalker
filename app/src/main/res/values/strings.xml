    <string name="intro">CityWalker is an application designed for people walking alone in the City of Melbourne at night feeling unsafe. Users can use it to check the road situation before they walk alone at night and call their emergency contact or send the current location to the emergency contact if an emergency happens during walking.</string>
    <string name="dataset">Open Data Source: \u2022 MapBox API (https://www.mapbox.com/maps/) \u2022 Google Map API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) \u2022 Safe City cameras of the City of Melbourne (https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/community/safety-emergency/Pages/safe-citycameras.aspx) \u2022 Local police station location (https://www.police.vic.gov.au/location)</string>

    <string name="user_location_permission_explanation">This app needs location permissions to show its functionality.</string>
    <string name="user_location_permission_not_granted">You didn\'t grant location permissions.</string>
    <string name="slogan"> Build a sense of safety while walking at night.</string>
    <string name="routecheck">User can find the safest route among the suggested routes before walking alone at night. By inputting the starting point and destination, several walking routes associated with CCTV cameras, police stations, pedestrian counting system sensors and 24-hour open stores and restaurants along the routes will be provided for users. Each route shows its safety score and the most suggested route with highest safety score among all suggested routes will be highlighted by default. When the user selects one of the other routes, the distance, walking duration and numbers of CCTV cameras and police stations of the corresponding route will be displayed in the bottom slidable hidden area with corresponding safety score.</string>
    <string name="emergencysupport"> User can set their emergency contact stored locally. When an emergency happens, the user can press the emergency call button to call their emergency contact or click the location sharing buttons to send a message containing their real-time location to the emergency contact. Moreover, the user can navigate to the nearest safety place(police station or 24-hour open stores) from your current location with one-click buttons.</string>
    <string name="safetytips"> User can see some safety with cartoon images in Safety Tips in order to get prepared and achieve confidence before walking alone at night.</string>

    <string name="q1">The busyness degree of each sensor is defined based on the prediction of total counts of the pedestrian at the current hour. With the history records of hourly readings of Pedestrian Counting System from May 2009 to March 2019, a Neural Network model is built to predict the total counts of specific sensors in particular hours of each day.</string>
    <string name="m1"> *** When the prediction of the specific hour is less than 600 - Usually not busy</string>
    <string name="m2"> *** When the prediction of the specific hour is between 600 and 1799 - Usually not too busy</string>
    <string name="m3"> *** When the prediction of the specific hour is between 1800 and 2999 - Usually a little busy</string>
    <string name="m4"> *** When the prediction of the specific hour is more than 2999 - Usually busy</string>
    <string name="q2"> The safest route among all suggested routes is provided by comparing the safety scores of all routes. The safety score is calculated based on the distance of the route and the quantities of safety factors (CCTV cameras, 24-hour open stores and police stations) along the routes, which means the more safety factors it has per meter, the higher safety score the route would have. </string>

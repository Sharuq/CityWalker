    <string name="dev"> Developed by The Guardians (TA16)</string>
    <string name="slogan"> Build a sense of safety while walking at night.</string>
    <string name="intro">CityWalker is an application designed for people walking alone in the City of Melbourne at night feeling unsafe. Users can use it to check the road situation before they walk alone at night and gain emergency support by calling their emergency contact or sending the current location to the emergency contact if an emergency happens during walking. To be prepared better, users can see some safety tips before walking.</string>
    <string name="routecheck"> When you input the starting point and destination, the routes and icons along the routes will be displayed. Each colour of the icons represents a safety factor and you can click it for more information. For the pedestrian counting system sensors, the latest reading of the sensor and the busyness degree from prediction are provided by clicking the corresponding icons. The currently highlighted route is the safest among the displayed routes with the highest safety scores showing in the bottom sheet. Select different routes on the map to see the differences and check the hidden part of the bottom sheet for the exact number of all safety factors along the selected routes. Currently, our application supports police stations, 24-hour open stores and restaurants, CCTV cameras and pedestrian counting system sensors as the safety factors.</string>
    <string name="emergencysupport"> Don’t forget to update your emergency contact in our application before you go. When you walking alone, you can click the red short-cut buttons on the main page or the Emergency Support page to call your emergency or send an emergency message starting with ‘HELP ME!’ with your current location information to him/her. Besides, you can also share your location in non-emergency time by clicking the blue location sharing button. Moreover, navigation to a safe place can find the nearest police station or 24-hour open stores around you and show the directions to you by one click.</string>
    <string name="safetytips"> Some normal but easily missed safety tips are shown in the safety tip cards with cartoon images. Slide them to see to achieve confidence before walking alone at night.</string>

    <string name="q1">The busyness degree of each sensor is defined based on the prediction of total counts of the pedestrian at the current hour. With the history records of hourly readings of Pedestrian Counting System from May 2009 to March 2019, a Neural Network model is built to predict the total counts of specific sensors in particular hours of each day.</string>
    <string name="m1"> • When the prediction of the specific hour is less than 600 - Usually not busy</string>
    <string name="m2"> • When the prediction of the specific hour is between 600 and 1799 - Usually not too busy</string>
    <string name="m3"> • When the prediction of the specific hour is between 1800 and 2999 - Usually a little busy</string>
    <string name="m4"> • When the prediction of the specific hour is more than 2999 - Usually busy</string>
    <string name="q2"> The safest route among all suggested routes is provided by comparing the safety scores of all routes. The safety score is calculated based on the distance of the route and the quantities of safety factors (CCTV cameras, 24-hour open stores and police stations) along the routes, which means the more safety factors it has per meter, the higher safety score the route would have. </string>
